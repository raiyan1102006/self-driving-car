# CNN-based Self-driving car
Codebase from Udemy's self-driving car course 
https://www.udemy.com/course/applied-deep-learningtm-the-complete-self-driving-car-course/

In this project, we use Udacity's open-source repo (https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim) to simulate a self driving car, and build a deep-learning model to predict the steering angles for the car.
